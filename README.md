# Travel Insurance Prediction Web App 


## Brief Explanation 
This Project has a goal to predict whether a customer of travel insurance company is willing to buy its' insurance product. 
Dataset was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data). Please upvote the dataset contributor if you guys do not mind.

The Project itself is deployed on streamlit, with following features : 

1. Exploratory Data Analysis Overview 
2. Custom Model Creation 
3. Prediction 


## Technology Stacks : 
1. Heroku for Deployment 
2. streamlit for web page creation 
3. Data processing packages / libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, seaborn , and etc. 
4. Machine Learning Model : sklearn, pycaret, lightgbm, pytorch

## Project Workflow 
1. Data Exploration -- data cleaning-visualization-encoding
2. Model Training -- splitting dataset-cross validation-final model-save model 
3. Creating interface -- layouting-adding menus
4. Deploy! 

##Project Structure 
In order to create this project i create several files including jupyter notebook and python scripts. 
1. [explore.ipynb]() for exploring the dataset from data cleaning to modelling 
2. [webpage.py]() python script for creating streamlit based web app 
3. [Procfile]() and [setup.sh]() for heroku deployment 
4. [poetry.lock]() for dependency management 
5. [Dockerfile]() for containerizing app 
6. 

## Metrics 

Since the dataset's target class is not well distributed we attempt to use ROC AUC Scoring
